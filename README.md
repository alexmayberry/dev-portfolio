This is my web development portfolio.



# Road Map

## 0.0 Create repository

## 0.1 Create Idex.html and style.css

## 0.2 Create header

## 0.3 Create project tile template
- Set up css grid and flexbox to responsively array and scale multiple project tiles
- Use media queries to control grid

## 0.4 Create footer (aka bio)
- create a responsive layout for it using css grid

## 0.5 Link bio-button to bio
- use `display:` and other means to make the bio in the footer appear whenever the bio-button is clicked

## 0.6 create a template project page that goes into greater detial about the project

## 0.7 Add a 'next project' or 'other projects' preview section at the bottom of the template project page.
Do this by using a pseudo class and `order` if possible.

## 0.8 Add :hover and other pseudo class functionality

## 0.9 Add pseudo element functinoality

## 1.0 - Fully functional and responsive site
The first version will be made using nested divs and classes to style the elements. I will also css grid and css flexbox to create the layout and control the responsiveness.

## Later Version
Add pseudo classes to create a filter for projects

## Later version
I will use `Sass` to create CSS variables which can easily be updated or varied to create dark mode or light mode
